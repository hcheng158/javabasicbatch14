What is software? Waterfall?
4pm PST is midnight at London

A machine readable code or a program that tells the computer how to perform tasks - programming code.
You can’t touch it.
Opposite of hardware - physical, screens, monitors, keyboard, system unit, speaker you can touch it.

Hard work, no magic and dedication
Group projects
Computers understand binary
Java is the most popular language
Python will be easier to learn
Java is free
Complier translate code into binary so the computer processor will be able to translate it. 
IDE is an integrated development environment
Eclipse you need a few windows: Project explorer or Package explorer
WINDOWS+SHIFT+S to screenshot on WINDOWS DAMNIT!
Menu - windows - show view - project explorer
Difference between project vs package 
Eclipse
1. Project Explorer
2. Console - use to view output of the program that we created.
3. Create Project
4. Create names without spaces JavaBasicsFromAsel - this is call camel casing
Create a package, com.syntax.class001, then create a new class inside of it
Java = cameltext. 
Public class is a program
{} uses curly braces
Double click on the curley brace to see the spaces of your class
You don’t need quotes for numbers, but alpha numeric you do.
Code is executed from top to bottom.
Data Types - 2 different types, and how we process them
Primitive	and 	Non Primitive
Primitive data types- numeric
1. Non primitive data types
2. Primitive data types



Numeric - whole numbers (1,2,3) 
4 data types: it’s about spacing and how much space it takes up. 1991, memory was an issue back in the day. Data must be stored it. Where will we store it? Inside of a container. 

Byte - 	123, 12, -128
Short - 10000 or 20000
Int - 		100000 //most popular
Long - credit cards or transactions
and decimals (1.99, 2.89)
Float - 1.89F;
Double = 99.99 //popular

Non numeric - 1 character ($, #, F, m, %)
Char - must use single quotes ‘A’ or ‘$’


Boolean - True/False statements
Right mouse click refactor change the file neame
Variable can not have a same name because it’s getting stored and java will not know what to do with it.

Review
Java classes, you need a main method
Public class recap {
Public static main(String[] args){


}
2 data types non primitive and primitive
8 data types for primitive
You can change the value of any variable 
1 variable can hold only 1 value at one time/per line, but you can change it
Variables syntax
dataType name;
String = Non primitive - use uppercase
A Value represented in “” double quotes more than one character
Do not create a class with the name String…please
Example: String address="213 Palm Ave.";
Example: String phone="111-222-5555";
Why do we need to specify these data type
Strings can’t be used in math
We will be using Strings quite a bit
//Rules for Identifiers=names (variables, methods, and other name of identifiers).
		//1. cannot use keywods as identifiers
		//String new = "hello"; = ERROR
		//2. Can't have spaces in identifiers
		// String lastname="Smith";
		//3. Identifiers cannot start with numbers
		//int 1number=123; = ERROR can't start with a number
		//int number1=123; this is fine
		//4. Identifiers can't contain any special characters except for dollar signs $ and underscore _
		//Identifers are just a name
		//Identifers Can't contain spaces
		//Nameing conventions: 
Operators Arithmetic

Review
Type casting is converting one data type to another on
Example convert a short to byte, 
Long to a float
2 main types implicit, widening, automatic, explicit - narrowing and manual,
When java converts, the data types automatically for us. It only happens when we assessing a smaller data type to a larger data type.
When casting, there is no data loss.
A smaller data type to a larger data type, because there is no data loss in this conversion.
explicit/narrowing/manual testing - why is it called narrowing because we converting something bigger into something small
Explicit = we call it that because we have to mention it
When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type, it is called
Explicit/narrowing./Manual. It doesn’t happen automatically we have to do it explicitly manually. 
Why should we learn type casting? We will use code from others to save time
We don’t usually use typecasting . We might also need to convert the data types to make our cade compatible with there code.

We use () and inside of the () we write the destination data type for example
if we want to convert a long to a int, this is how to we do it
long var1=250; //long is a larger data gype than int
int var2=(int)var1; //it's explicit manual or narrowing
float f=250f;
double d=f;///implicit/widening automatic.

if else conditions
	if else conditions help us write code that can take the decision based on data
if else if
why do we need to learn if else?
Because when we are solving a real life problem like
testing a website out programsneed to make a lot of decisions
when you enter the username and password.
if the given username and password matches go to the home page
Else give the user a warning

Nest if conditions
